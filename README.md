# Neovim Config (Lazy)

Neovim configuration written from scratch. 
Adapting my old config to newer, better practices.

This is the third (or maybe fourth or maybe even fifth) time I'm remaking the configuration and this one is based on Lazy (after I realized how awesome it it). Of course this journey being never-ending I will have to do all of this all over again with a new native plugin manager, but oh well. 
This time we are using Mason for LSP management, because why the heck not. Also removed a bunch of useless plugins.

## Requirements

- Neovim ^9.0.0
- NodeJS ^16.18.0
- Cmake ^3.31.0
- [Nix Package Manager](https://nixos.org/download/#nix-quick-install)
